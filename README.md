# SRoutes
A webfronted to view and create Speedrunning routes based upon waypoints that can have various requirements/flags

This project is meant to simplify the creation and management of Speedrunning routes in various ways:
* Showing wether a route is even possible by utilising requirements
* Helping to estimate time(s) and segment times
* Whatever I think of next
